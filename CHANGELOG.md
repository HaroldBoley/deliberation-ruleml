### Added

### Changed
- stripe-skipping was modularized to separate the skipping of if-then stripes in Imples and the skipping of op. This change allows for fine-tuning of stripe-skipping to accommodate conversion to XSD in those cases where skipping of particular edges leads to XSD validation errors. [issue47]
- examples in the exa/ directory were improved, including
  - inserting xml-model processing instructions
