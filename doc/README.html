<p>
   This directory contains automatically-generated schema docs for several anchor languages of the Deliberation RuleML 1.02 family. The normalized serialization is documented, for brevity. A selection of anchor languages is made available, ranging from the supremum language <a href="nafhologeq_normal">nafhologeq</a> to the minimal <a href="datalogplus_min_normal">datalogplus</a>. The <a href="http://deliberation.ruleml.org/1.02/doc/naffologeq_normal">naffologeq</a> language, which was the supremum language of previous versions from 0.91 to 1.01, is also available for comparison purposes. Additionally, an intermediate language, <a href="disdatalogplus_mid_normal">disdatalogplus_mid</a> demonstrates how <a href="http://deliberation.ruleml.org/1.02/myng">MYNG</a> may be used to define precisely a customized language including (only) selected features.

  <a href="http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/Content_Models_of_Deliberation_RuleML_1.02#HTML_Schemadocs">schema docs</a> section of the Deliberation RuleML 1.02 Content Models document for details on the generation process of the schema docs from the Relax NG pivot schemas
